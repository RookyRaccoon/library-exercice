# library-exercice

Given the time that was recommended during the interviex (1-2 hours), I tried to respect the timing and produce what I could during.

I chose to use Flask instead of Django because it seemed to make more sense given the size and time to spend on the exercice.

I used Flask Restful, so all my HTTP methods are grouped by data types through Ressources.

I used JWT token for a "mock" authentication service because I used in in a few other projects so it seemed the quickest to me. 


What I did not do: 
Authorization, there is no proper checking of access rights for a user. I could have used OAuth2 to have a server checking for authorization.
